/*
this class is a function about costing fuel when the probe moving and especially when Probe approch the surface of the moon
using the energy conservation theorem 

Vairable:
M: the rocket mass
m: mass of expell fuel
Ve:relative velocity
V0:initial velocity of rocket
Vr:final Velocity of the rocket

initial momentum=Final momentum
mass*velocity is momentum
(M+m)*V0=M*Vr+(V0-Ve)m

M(Vr-V0)/▲t=Ve*▲m/▲t

Thrust=F=Ma=Ve*(m#) m#:expelled of fuel mass flow rate.
